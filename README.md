HOW TO RUN THE PROJECT?
========================
Follow the below instructions:

* Ensure the node and npm are already installed in the system.
* Execute "npm install".
* Execute "npm run dev". This command will run the development server.
* Open a browser and go to http://localhost:8080


FEATURES TO CONSIDER
====================
* Build process using Webpack (Cleaner than Gulp/Grunt).
* Coding styleguide using Standard library. ($ npm run standard)
* Development Server. ($ npm run dev)
* Distributable folder. ($ npm run build)
* BEM stylesheets.
* Cool data spike normalizer! (I was struggling so much with it, check WebsocketRadio::normalyzeSpike)

NOTES
=====
* Read source code for tons of comments!

Thanks.
